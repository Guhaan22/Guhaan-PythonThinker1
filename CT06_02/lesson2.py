# Task: Write down the steps on how to solve the problem below

# Design pseudocode for a recycling robot that sorts items
# into bins for glass, plastic, and paper. The robot should
# check each item's material and place it in the correct bin.
repeat forever
if item is a glass item, dispose it into glass recycling bin
if item is a plastic item, dispose it into the plastic recycling bin
if item is a paper item, dispose it into the paper recycling bin
if item is not any of the three, dispose it into the incinerator.

create a list and assign it to "glass_bin" 
create a list and assign it to "plastic_bin" 
create a list and assign it to "paper_bin" 

if item == glass
    glass_bin.
else

    start with 1 and go up to ten

    if answer equals to 7 then say yippee
    if answer is not equal to 7 then say try again

# Task: Using pseudocode, design a program that will check if the
# user has entered the right secret phrase.

# 1. If the user has entered a wrong secret phrase, send them an
# error message.
# 1. If the user has entered the right secret phrase, congratulate

#  Task: Write a pseudocode that calculates the final score of a student
# based on the following weightage:
# _each test is scored upon 100_
# Test 1 = 20%
# Test 2 = 40%
# Test 3 = 40%

first, we multiply 100 times 3
then we add the  percentages of all three tests
after that we divide the student's combined score by 3
Done Teacher Amos!
