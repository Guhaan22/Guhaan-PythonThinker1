# Lesson 6 - Debugging

## Recap 1: Class Average Calculator

# You have been tasked to create a programme that calculates the
# average marks of a class.

# Your programme will have to ask the
# user for the total number of students, followed by the marks of
# each student one at a time.

# Use only variables, math operators that you have learnt, as
# well as a 'for' loop.
