# Task 6: Flowchart for Temperature Monitor
# You are analyzing daily temperature readings over a week.
# Write a program to count how many days had a temperature
# that is greater than 30.

# Draw out the flowchart (on a piece of paper) of the above
# program.

# 1. Start with creating and assigning the variable
#    "positive_days" to 0 before the loop.
# 2. Use a for loop to iterate through each day of the week
#    (7 times)
# 3. In each iteration the loop, prompt the user to input the
#    temperature for the day.
# 4. Use an 'if' condition to check if the temperature is greater
#    than 30. If so, increase the variable 'positive_days' by
#    1
# 5. After the loop, print the count of days with temperature
#    higher than 30.

# Task 8: Summing Positive Numbers
# **Task 8a**:
# Draw out the flowchart (on a piece of paper) of a program
# that will calculate the total sum of **savings** 
# (include in total only if savings for that day is positive)
# from a week's worth of data provided by the user every day.

# 1. Create and assign 'sum' variable to 0.
# 2. Use a 'for' loop to iterate through each day of the week
#    (7 times)
# 3. In each iteration, prompt the user to input the
#    savings for the day.
# 4. Use an if condition to check if the savings is greater
#    than 0. If so, increase the variable 'sum' by
#    that day's savings.
# 5. After the loop, print the sum of savings for that week
