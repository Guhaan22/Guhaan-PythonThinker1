# Lesson 4 - Strings

## Recap 1: Sushi Checkout

# You just had a lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to
# calculate the total amount you have spent. Different coloured
# plates costs different as shown below:

# Red = $1
# Blue = $2
# Green = $3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates, and 4
# green plates.

# Calculate and print the total amount you have spent: -->
R = 1
B = 2
G = 3
# print(R*3 + B*5 + G*4)
# MyAge = input("What is your age?")
# type("age")

## Task 1: Storing and printing Strings

# **Task 1a**:
# Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and
# store it in a variable. Then print that variable.

# **Task 1b**:
# Ask the user for their favorite colour using input() and
# store the response in a variable. Print the variable.

# **Task 1c**:
# Ask the user for their age using input() and store the answer
# in a variable. Print the variable.
YourName = input("What is your name?: ")
print(YourName)
YourColour = input("What is your favorite colour?: ")
print(YourColour)
YourAge = input("What is your age?: ")
